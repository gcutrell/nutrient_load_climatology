# climatology
The initial impetus for this climatology tool is to interactively present daily estimates of cumulative nutrient
loadings delivered to the Western Basin of Lake Erie via the Maumee River. The March-July total load is strongly
correlated with the extent and intensity of algal blooms in August and beyond.

The tool and surrounding page were prototyped in 2015, and will be formally released in 2016. There is therefore 
an opportunity to incorporate additional features into the tool to improve its utility to a general audience, such as:

  - Animated build and exploration, including playback
  
  - Alternate aggregation periods (week, month)
  
  - Alternate definitions of year (360-day, leap year handling alternatives)
  
  - Input specification - location, type

  - control boundaries - percentiles, confidence intervals
  
  - "Functional boxplot" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_boxplot

Please contact Tad Slawecki (tslawecki@limno.com) if you have ideas ... or if you can point to a formal definition or term of art for the chart prodcut hear (climatograph? calimatology chart? ...?).
